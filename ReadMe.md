# PokÃ©mon Battle field - 48 hours

## Description

Implement and code a program that receives the names of 2 pokemons and simulates a battle between the two, the winner will be decided by a calculation of the stats.change field.

In addition to this, you should show each pokemons ID card (general information) by fetching data from the pokeapi.co for each given name .

- Use models for the pokemons
- The program should handle errors.
- The program should have a cache mechanism.
- Use Docker containers
- All battle data should be saved in a DB (up to you which db to use)
- The project should include unit tests and documentation.
